The task was to mine for relevant data and presenting them in a manner that would simplify the decision making process in picking countries as case studies.

-   The aim of the research paper was to assess the state and level of data protection regulation in Africa in order to;

    -   Get a deeper feel of the trends present among the countries,

    -   To find out which nations are to a more degree exposed to data mishandling,

    -   To find out which countries have strategies in place to safeguard their citizens\' right of privacy.

> The following are some of the visuals that I had then created.
