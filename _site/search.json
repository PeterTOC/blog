    "text": "Web Scraping Etiquette\nA wise philosopher named Ben once said\n\n“with great power comes great responsibility”\n\nWell this relates to a lot of things and Data Scraping is no exception.\nThe following are three staples for scraping politeness;\n\nIntroduce yourself\nIt is always a good idea to leave an introductory note in the User-Agent Field, the note should include your email and purpose of scraping. exaple below; \nThrottle your requests\nAs web scraping by code does not offer the natural buffer between requests to a website like one would do when retrieving the data manually, and while servers for websites like Wikipedia would likely not feel a thing. One can easily overload a server if the frequency of requests is not supported, especially when dealing with large amounts of data. If many people are simultaneously trying to get a massive amount of data this could easily overwhelm the system which can hurt a service provider, we do not want that..\nCite your source\nWell this golden rule depends on the reason of scraping, It is always Imperative that we cite our data sources in any publication.\n\nNow let me introduce my personal tenets to webscraping I have learned to abide by given my experience;"

    "section": "Webscraping tenets",
    "text": "Webscraping tenets\n\n\nXpaths over CSS selectors\n\nWhen web scraping you are going to want to select items of interest from the target of interest, and depending on what language you use to code, it normally comes down to whether you are going to identify the items for your script by their CSS/HTML tags or by their xpaths. From my recent endevours I have found the latter to be a more robust option as the xpaths tend to be more uniform throughout most pages.\n\n\n\nHope for the best, Plan for the worst\n\nWhile scraping it’s good practise to test out your script on the web pages of interest, we are not always sure the web format will always remain the same in the future. So it is important to have a contigency plan, for instance you would much rather have your script impute ’NA’s on items it failed to scrape and continue with its scraping, instead of having your script fail and stop on its first obstacle. In R this can be achieved by functions like safely() and possibly() in the tidyverse ecosystem.\n\n\n\nIf your Internet is shaky, increase your timeout limit\n\nI, for one, do not have very reliable internet service so my script kept getting timed out in between the requests, and when you are timed out, your script goes sit on a corner. You get an error with no results. as a solution I simply increased my timeout limit to 60 seconds and I had no further issues.\n\n\n\nFunctional programming FOR THE WIN!\n\nThis is a concept I learned of recently that eases the process of repetitive tasks.\n\n\n\nFor instance, for a task where we are supposed to scrape a parent page, extract the links of several job posts from the parent page, then exctract information from the individual pages from each of the links scraped from the parent page. Writing code to scrape each page individually will be time draining, to say the least.\nUsing functional programming this can be acheived as follows;\n\npick a link from the list of pages to scrape\nwrite code to scrape the target info from that one page\nif code works, turn code into a function\nmap the function to the whole list of url links (remember to throttle requests as explained above and to allow for failed attempts)\ntabulate results\n\nBelow is sample script in R for a recent webscraping project I did recently using the principles above toobtain the data to create this dashboard. hosted on github pages.\n\n\nClick to view sample code\n\n# script to extract to webscrape indeed for entry level data scientist\n\n# Author: Peter Boshe\n# Version: 2022-05-07\n\n# Packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(httr)\nlibrary(broom)\nrequire(wordcloud2)\nrequire(tm)\n\n# Parameters\nurl <- \"https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=entry%20level%20data%20scientist&l=Remote&from=searchOnHP&vjk=e4dd563aa0c5df59\"\ndomain <- \"https://www.indeed.com\"\nfile_out <- here::here(\"data/table.rds\")\nfile_out2 <- here::here(\"data/wordcloud.html\")\nreport <- here::here(\"index.Rmd\")\nhtml_output <- here:: here(\"docs/\")\nlog_output <- here::here(\"data/logs/\")\n\n# ============================================================================\n\n# Code\n\n\n\nhtml <- url |>\n  GET(timeout(60)) |>\n  read_html()\n\n\njob_title <- html |>\n  html_nodes(\"span[title]\") |>\n  html_text()\n\n\ncompany <- html |>\n  html_nodes(\"span.companyName\") |>\n  html_text()\n\nlocation <- html |>\n  html_nodes(\"div.companyLocation\") |>\n  html_text()\n\n\nlinks <- html |>\n  html_nodes(xpath = \"/html/body//tbody//div[1]/h2/a\") |>\n  html_attr(\"href\")\n\nmax_length <- length(job_title)\ndf <- data.frame(job_title,\n                 company,\n                 location,\n                 domain,\n                 links) |>\n  mutate(url_link = str_c(domain,\"\",links)) |>\n  select(job_title, company, location, url_link)\n\n\n# second iteration through the links --------------------------------------\n\n# test with one link\n\n# x <- \"https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=655e1551430353b4&fccid=11619ce0d3c2c733&vjs=3\"\n\nextract_description <- function(x) {\n\n  Sys.sleep(2) # to pause between requests\n\n  cat(\".\") # stone age progress bar\n\n  # html2 <- read_html(x)\n  html2 <- x |>\n    GET(timeout(60)) |> # important to not get timed out in some of the requests\n    read_html()\n\n  job_description <- html2 |>\n    html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@id=\"jobDescriptionText\"]') |>\n    html_text() |>\n    str_squish()\n\n  count_r <- job_description |>\n    str_count('[./ ,]R{1}[./ ,]')\n\n  r_present <- job_description |>\n    str_detect('[./ ,]R{1}[./ ,]')\n\n\n  data.frame(job_description = job_description,\n         r_present = r_present,\n         count_r = count_r)    #important to name the variables to avoid script failure\n\n}\n\n\n# functional programming for the win!
