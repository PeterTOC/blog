One can easily overload a server if the frequency of requests is not supported, especially when dealing with large amounts of data. If many people are simultaneously trying to get a massive amount of data this could easily overwhelm the system which can hurt a service provider, we do not want that..\nCite your source\nWell this golden rule depends on the reason of scraping, It is always Imperative that we cite our data sources in any publication.\n\nNow let me introduce my personal tenets to webscraping I have learned to abide by given my experience;"

    "text": "Webscraping tenets\n\n\nXpaths over CSS selectors\n\nWhen web scraping you are going to want to select items of interest from the target of interest, and depending on what language you use to code, it normally comes down to whether you are going to identify the items for your script by their CSS/HTML tags or by their xpaths. From my recent endevours I have found the latter to be a more robust option as the xpaths tend to be more uniform throughout most pages.\n\n\n\nHope for the best, Plan for the worst\n\nWhile scraping it‚Äôs good practise to test out your script on the web pages of interest, we are not always sure the web format will always remain the same in the future. So it is important to have a contigency plan, for instance you would much rather have your script impute ‚ÄôNA‚Äôs on items it failed to scrape and continue with its scraping, instead of having your script fail and stop on its first obstacle. In R this can be achieved by functions like safely() and possibly() in the tidyverse ecosystem.\n\n\n\nIf your Internet is shaky, increase your timeout limit\n\nI, for one, do not have very reliable internet service so my script kept getting timed out in between the requests, and when you are timed out, your script goes sit on a corner. You get an error with no results. as a solution I simply increased my timeout limit to 60 seconds and I had no further issues.\n\n\n\nFunctional programming FOR THE WIN!\n\nThis is a concept I learned of recently that eases the process of repetitive tasks.\n\n\n\nFor instance, for a task where we are supposed to scrape a parent page, extract the links of several job posts from the parent page, then exctract information from the individual pages from each of the links scraped from the parent page. Writing code to scrape each page individually will be time draining, to say the least.\nUsing functional programming this can be acheived as follows;\n\npick a link from the list of pages to scrape\nwrite code to scrape the target info from that one page\nif code works, turn code into a function\nmap the function to the whole list of url links (remember to throttle requests as explained above and to allow for failed attempts)\ntabulate results\n\nBelow is sample script in R for a recent webscraping project I did recently using the principles above toobtain the data to create this dashboard. hosted on github pages.\n\n\nCode\n\n# script to extract to webscrape indeed for entry level data scientist\n\n# Author: Peter Boshe\n# Version: 2022-05-07\n\n# Packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(httr)\nlibrary(broom)\nrequire(wordcloud2)\nrequire(tm)\n\n# Parameters\nurl &lt;- \"https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=entry%20level%20data%20scientist&l=Remote&from=searchOnHP&vjk=e4dd563aa0c5df59\"\ndomain &lt;- \"https://www.indeed.com\"\nfile_out &lt;- here::here(\"data/table.rds\")\nfile_out2 &lt;- here::here(\"data/wordcloud.html\")\nreport &lt;- here::here(\"index.Rmd\")\nhtml_output &lt;- here:: here(\"docs/\")\nlog_output &lt;- here::here(\"data/logs/\")\n\n# ============================================================================\n\n# Code\n\n\n\nhtml &lt;- url |&gt;\n  GET(timeout(60)) |&gt;\n  read_html()\n\n\njob_title &lt;- html |&gt;\n  html_nodes(\"span[title]\") |&gt;\n  html_text()\n\n\ncompany &lt;- html |&gt;\n  html_nodes(\"span.companyName\") |&gt;\n  html_text()\n\nlocation &lt;- html |&gt;\n  html_nodes(\"div.companyLocation\") |&gt;\n  html_text()\n\n\nlinks &lt;- html |&gt;\n  html_nodes(xpath = \"/html/body//tbody//div[1]/h2/a\") |&gt;\n  html_attr(\"href\")\n\nmax_length &lt;- length(job_title)\ndf &lt;- data.frame(job_title,\n                 company,\n                 location,\n                 domain,\n                 links) |&gt;\n  mutate(url_link = str_c(domain,\"\",links)) |&gt;\n  select(job_title, company, location, url_link)\n\n\n# second iteration through the links --------------------------------------\n\n# test with one link\n\n# x &lt;- \"https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=655e1551430353b4&fccid=11619ce0d3c2c733&vjs=3\"\n\nextract_description &lt;- function(x) {\n\n  Sys.sleep(2) # to pause between requests\n\n  cat(\".\") # stone age progress bar\n\n  # html2 &lt;- read_html(x)\n  html2 &lt;- x |&gt;\n    GET(timeout(60)) |&gt; # important to not get timed out in some of the requests\n    read_html()\n\n  job_description &lt;- html2 |&gt;\n    html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@id=\"jobDescriptionText\"]') |&gt;\n    html_text() |&gt;\n    str_squish()\n\n  count_r &lt;- job_description |&gt;\n    str_count('[./ ,]R{1}[./ ,]')\n\n  r_present &lt;- job_description |&gt;\n    str_detect('[./ ,]R{1}[./ ,]')\n\n\n  data.frame(job_description = job_description,\n         r_present = r_present,\n         count_r = count_r)    #important to name the variables to avoid script failure\n\n}\n\n\n# functional programming for the win!

The five countries are;\n\nBurundi\nKenya\nUganda\nRwanda\nTanzania\n\nNote: This Analysis is purely exploratory in nature, and correlation is not proof of causation.\n\n\n\nThis introductory plot shows the trends of the current account balance and some major events that took place during our time period of interest. Although there might be several first-takes but mine was, ‚Äúwhat happened in the 2000s ? and is it still happening?‚Äù\nThis plot, however, does not give granular insight to trends. As one would wonder why country‚Äôs account balances took steep dives even after events like SAPs transitions, G8 summit in 2005 and the 2000 Jubilee.\nThe current account balance is a result of various factors like new grants, disbursements, debt forgiveness grants, principal repayments to external debt, reserves and many more.\n\n\nIn the following sections we will be looking at some of the factors that account to the current account balance sum, and we will see how they relate with some of the major events. Let‚Äôs dive right in.\n\n\n\nWe see a collective spike in debt forgiveness grants after the G8 summit (so meetings do work!), however Kenya and Burundi seem to be left out on the action. It would be interesting to know if they were withheld due to not meeting the same criteria that left Kenya out of the HIPC initiative in 1996. (links to resources below plot)\n\nIn June 2005, the Group of Eight (G8) gathering of the worlds most developed economies, resolved, through their finance ministers, to grant total debt relief to 18 countries that had reached ‚Äòcompletion point‚Äô, amounting to $40 billion. Fourteen of these countries are in Africa. Foreign aid, debt relief and Africa‚Äôs development: problems and prospects. 2009.\n\nThe World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other multilateral, bilateral and commercial creditors began the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in 1996, However among the East African countries, Kenya does not meet the criteria to receive debt relief. Countries must make full use of traditional debt-relief mechanisms to be eligible for debt relief under the HIPC Initiative.

How do we give a parameter we ourselves do not have?\n\nscree plots to the rescue !!!\n\n\ntheir main purpose is to give us a good starting point on deciding how many clusters we are to assign.\nachieved by creating a grid of results based on different centers\nthe optimum number of clusters would be found at the ‚Äòelbow‚Äô of the plot.\n\n\nThe screeplot(elbow plot) appears to have the elbow we are interested in around k = 3.

Dimension reduction by PCA\nA PCA (Principal Component Analysis) scree plot will show how much variability of the data is explained by each Principal Component after reducing our number of variables, in that effect, gives us a feel of how many PCs it would take to properly represent our data.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è From the PCA screeplot shows that PC1, PC2 and PC3 combined explains only about 66% of the variance in our data, so even a 3D plot with PCA values would not be the best representation of our data.\nOut of curiosity, let us plot the clusters on the 2 PCs (PC1 and PC2) anyway and see how it looks in a 2 dimensional space, our x-y axis.\n\nNow lets try a non-linear approach..\n\n\n2. Dimension reduction by UMAP\nNow let‚Äôs see how the non-linear approach results differ in the 2D space\n\nEven without the red flag we got from the PCA‚Äôs performance on this specific dataset, I personally like the cluster representation in the latter approach.\nAnd now with a dimension reduction approach we are happy with, we can see how different k values may look in an x-y plane. let‚Äôs plot 9 trials."
